# blitzware-ios
Mobile IOS app for my other project BlitzWare. Project for the course "Mobile Application Development: iOS".

> Login details to test the app (or make/register a new account yourself on the RegisterView):
- Username: Lander

> I've noticed that the HoGent network sometimes blocks my api (api.blitzware.xyz). So when there seems to be no response of the api when using the mobile app, this could be due to the HoGent network blocking the api used in the app. Please, if this happens, use a VPN.
